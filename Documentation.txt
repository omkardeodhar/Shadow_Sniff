													ShadowSniff Documentation:-
Introduction:-
Shadowsniff is a non-intrusive network sniffer tool that captures and analyzes network packets. It allows users to monitor various network protocols and provides valuable insights into the network traffic. 

Features:-
Packet Capturing: Captures network packets for analysis.
Protocol Support: Recognizes and processes the following protocols:
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
DNS (Domain Name System)
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Real-time Display: Displays packet information and statistics in real-time during the packet capture process.
Logging: Logs captured packet information to a file (log.txt) for later analysis.
Customizable Capture Duration: Allows users to specify the duration (in seconds) for capturing packets.
User-friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for interacting with the tool.

Usage:-
Download the Sniff.py file.
Install the dependencies using pip install scapy or pip3 install scapy.
If python is not installed then install it using the following command: sudo apt install python or sudo apt install python3.
Install Colorama using pip install colorama.
Create a file named ‘log.txt’ in the same directory as the sniff.py file.
Warning: Run the tool using superuser privileges only.
To capture packets, run the following command: python sniff.py or python3 sniff.py in the Linux terminal.
This code is only Linux compatible. It does not work with Windows due to permission conflicts and due to unavailability of libraries.

Log File Details:-
This tool logs the captured packet information to a file named log.txt. The log file contains the following details for each packet:
Packet count: Total number of packets captured
Timestamp: Date and Time
Protocol-specific information:
ICMP: ICMP type, ICMP code, packet length, source IP, destination IP.
DNS: DNS query, packet length, source IP, destination IP.
ARP: ARP source IP, ARP destination IP, ARP operations, packet length.
TCP: Source port, destination port, packet length, source IP, destination IP, protocol (TCP).
UDP: Source port, destination port, packet length, source IP, destination IP, protocol (UDP).
